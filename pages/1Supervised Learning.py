    text = """**Supervised Learning:**
    \nSupervised learning is a branch of machine learning where algorithms learn from labeled data. 
    This data consists of input features (X) and corresponding outputs or labels (y). The algorithm learns a 
    mapping function from the input features to the outputs, allowing it to predict the labels for 
    unseen data points.
    \n**Classification:**
    Classification is a specific task within supervised learning where the labels belong to discrete 
    categories. The goal is to build a model that can predict the category label of a new data 
    point based on its features.
    \n**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):**
    KNN is a simple yet powerful algorithm for both classification and regression tasks. 
    \n**The Mushroom Dataset:**
    This dataset includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of 
    gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom, drawn from The Audubon Society 
    Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). It contains 200 samples of mushrooms which are 
    identified as either edible or poisonous.\n
    Each mushrooms have the following features:
    * Cap Diameter (cm)
    * Cap Shape
    * Cap Surface
    * Stem Height (cm)
    * Stem width (cm)
    * etc.
    \n**KNN Classification with Mushroom Edibility:**
    \n1. **Training:**
    * The KNN algorithm stores the entire Iris dataset (features and labels) as its training data.
    \n2. **Prediction:**
    * When presented with a new mushroom (unseen data), KNN calculates the distance (often Euclidean distance) 
    between this mushroom's features and all the mushrooms in the training data.
    * The user defines the value of 'k' (number of nearest neighbors). KNN identifies the 'k' closest 
    data points (mushrooms) in the training set to the new mushroom.
    * KNN predicts the class label (edibility) for the new mushroom based on the majority vote among its 
    'k' nearest neighbors. For example, if three out of the five nearest neighbors belong to edible, 
    the mushroom is classified as edible.
    **Choosing 'k':**
    The value of 'k' significantly impacts KNN performance. A small 'k' value might lead to overfitting, where the 
    model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data. Conversely, a large 'k' value might not 
    capture the local patterns in the data and lead to underfitting. The optimal 'k' value is often determined 
    through experimentation.
    \n**Advantages of KNN:**
    * Simple to understand and implement.
    * No complex model training required.
    * Effective for datasets with well-defined clusters."""
